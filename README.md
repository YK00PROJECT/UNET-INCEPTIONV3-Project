# Waste Classification Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to address the challenge of waste classification through the implementation of deep learning models. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of waste images, we utilize the power of neural networks to accurately classify various types of waste, helping facilitate more efficient recycling processes. The core of the project is built on a pre-trained InceptionV3 model adapted for high-accuracy waste classification.

## Repository Contents
- **Model Training and Evaluation Scripts:** Python scripts for training the deep learning model and evaluating its performance.
- **Visualization Tools:** Scripts for visualizing training results, including loss and accuracy curves, as well as predictions on test images.
- **Pre-trained Model Weights:** Links to download the pre-trained InceptionV3 model weights used for transfer learning.
- **Sample Images and Predictions:** Visualization of model predictions on random images from the dataset.
- **Utility Functions:** Helper functions for handling data preprocessing, model checkpointing, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of thousands of labeled images categorized into two main classes of waste. It is organized into separate training and testing folders:
- **Training Set:** 22,564 images
- **Testing Set:** 2,513 images

## Model Details
The model architecture includes:
- **InceptionV3:** Used as the backbone for feature extraction, with weights pre-trained on ImageNet.
- **U_Net:** Additional layers added on top of InceptionV3 to tailor the model for the task of waste classification.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/waste-classification-project.git
   cd waste-classification-project
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set Up Kaggle API Credentials:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/.kaggle/
   cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
   chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
   ```

4. Download and Prepare the Dataset:
   ```bash
   kaggle datasets download techsash/waste-classification-data
   unzip waste-classification-data.zip -d DATASET
   ```

## Usage
To train and evaluate the model, run the training script:
```bash
python train_model.py
```
This script will automatically handle the training and validation processes, store the best model weights, and display performance metrics.

## Results Visualization
- **Loss and Accuracy Curves:** Plotted to show the training and validation loss and accuracy throughout the epochs.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Generated to evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set.
- **Random Image Predictions:** Visual representations of model predictions on randomly selected images.

## Future Work
- Explore more sophisticated models and architectures to improve classification accuracy.
- Implement real-time classification systems for industrial applications.
- Extend the dataset to include more diverse types of waste materials.
